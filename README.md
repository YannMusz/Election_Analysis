# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project was to conduct an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections 

What will be determined by the outcome is the following
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Tools Utilized to Complete Analysis
The [Election Results Data](https://github.com/YannMusz/Election_Analysis/tree/main/Resources), in a CSV file format, was analyzed by running Python scripts in Visual Studio Code.
